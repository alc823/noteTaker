# Description
This project is part of a group of projects I worked on while participating in an internship preparation program called Launch (by HackCville). This was the second solo project, and it was assigned after the second technical workshop in the program, which was also the second time I had ever worked with React. The note taker app was an exercise in getting accustomed to state; this app allows users to make notes, assign categories to each note, and filter notes by category. Some emphasis was put on making the application visually appealing; we were encouraged, with this project, to experiment with how much technical functionality we could implement as well.
<br><br>
While this was a great exercise in experimenting with React and front-end design, reflecting on this project, there are a number of improvements I would work on if I returned to this project. Most recently, I edited a bit of the code to make the project slightly more responsive, and I definitely would pursue this endeavor further to make the website flexible so that it remains visually pleasing for any screen. Another future direction to take is to implement user login and allow users to save their notes. Currently, the website will discard any information stored upon refresh. In order to allow notes to persist over time, authentication can be added and user data can be stored using Firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Deployment link for application: https://note-taker-alc823.netlify.app.


# How to run the project (from React)
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
